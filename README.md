# Dungeons & Dragons Class Picker

The [D&D Class Picker](https://jfpaliga.github.io/dnd-class-picker/) website is a page built for those who play or are interested in playing the tabletop role-playing game, Dungeons & Dragons.

The goal of this site is to provide users with a fun quiz, where the user will answer a series of questions with answers they feel suit them best, and at the end of the quiz they are provided with a class to play and a tongue-in-cheek description of that class.

Users will enter a character name at the beginning of the quiz in an entry form, then interact with the quiz through a series of buttons before reaching the solution page.

The target audience would be users who already have an interest in Dungeons & Dragons, and either want to try the quiz for fun or use it to give them an idea of what type of character they could play.
